I believe my Uncle Oli has contacted you regarding my visitto Cape Town; if you are not too busy, I would very much like to chat withyou and learn more about South Africa and your experience living here. OuriX classes are in the morning and afternoon, so if you are available in theevening, perhaps we can arrange a time to meet? I just arrived today andwill be here until August 19th.A little about me: I study Statistics and English at UCLA, and the iXcourses I'm taking are teaching me skills that I can use in data science.I'm interested in everything, but I tend to gravitate toward literature andart. I love talking to my uncle about history, and I hope to learn moreabout the history and culture in SA in order to better understand my placeas a temporary student/resident of Cape Town and, more generally, a youngperson in an ever-changing world! I also love reading, writing, and meetingnew people.Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you!Best,Aida Ylanan-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Statistics B.S. | English Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | +01 (562) 673-1996"

Thank you, and the rest of the iX team, forgetting us safely and easily settled into our rooms.I'm sorry for asking this so late, but I was wondering, is it at allpossible to switch courses at this time? I was hoping to transition fromthe Data Science course into the Applied AI course. This past quarter atschool, I received some training regarding the mechanisms behind andapplications of machine learning, from both a computer science and astatistical perspective. I'm super fascinated by what I've learned so far,and I really hope for a chance to build upon the skills and knowledge I'vepicked up so far.I have a full year of experience in coding using R/R Studio and have donesome training in Python (for data science and machine learning,specifically). I'd be happy to take any coding challenges to see if myexperience would suffice for the course.

It's coming up on *May 18th*! Andit's a special one so make sure you read the whole email for all thedetails.Our next College Night is for the world premiere of *Actually* by AnnaZiegler. The play tells the story of Amber and Tom, finding their way asfreshmen at Princeton, spend a night together that alters the course oftheir lives. They agree on the drinking, they agree on the attraction, butconsent is foggy, and if unspoken, can it be called consent? A playwright *TheNew York Times* calls ‰ÛÏnewly (and justly) hot,‰Û Anna Ziegler investigatesgender and race politics, our crippling desire to fit in and the threesides to every story.The play stars Jerry MacKinnon (*Sleepy Hollow*) and Samantha Ressler (*Thisis the End*), and is brought to you *free of charge* and *free food* withthe generous support of The Biller Foundation. You read that right, thisone is free, and so is the food. That said, there are *only **40tickets* availablefor this College Night so get your tickets now! See below for our offercode and other information, with a link to get your tickets.College Night! *Actually* by Anna Ziegler.Thursday, May 18th.

The event is free and open to thepublic, RSVP below:http://www.geffenplayhouse.org/more_info.php?show_id=270As always, its a pleasure having you at the Geffen Playhouse and we hopeyou'll join us for this urgently relevant play.

"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:36:54 -0700","Hi Zoe,Here are some replies I would make if I heard a microaggression during atour conversation:   - (engage in dialogue) Why do you believe what you said to be true?   - (more direct response) I don't think that kind of language helps move   the conversation forward and would appreciate it if you refrained from   saying that.I found myself having trouble writing a single response to microaggressionssince, as we said, they come in various forms and with different intents. Ifound the most practical approach, for me, was to respond to the prompt bya) writing multiple responses that b) approached the microaggression fromdifferent angles. I'll keep a general statement (like the one you wrote) inmy back pocket, though: if the conversation with the aggressor were toderail into something more confrontational, then I think having a short,pithy summary of our Hammer values would end the ordeal in a respectfulway.Best,Aida-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Statistics B.S. | English Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

I'm near the end of myallotted 1.5-2 pages of close reading, and I've found that I've analyzedonly up to the 4th line of the 17 line selection I made for the paper... soI'm curious, is the 15-20 line requirement a hard and fast rule for theclose reading assignment? Can we instead choose a shorter part of thepassage and *really* close read that instead?I've done a more macroscopic close reading of the 17 line passage in mybook annotations, identifying apostrophe and repetition and enjambment andall, but I don't think I have enough space to talk about all I've noticedin a nuanced and meaningful way.Thank you, and sorry if I'm going overboard with this.Aida-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Statistics B.S. | English Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

I amso so sorry about the delayed response... finals week wrapped up lastFriday, so now I'll have a bit more time to devote to extracurricularopportunities.I wanted to thank you, first of all, for taking the time to open the doorand inform me of the opportunities offered at your company! I appreciate ita lot, especially as a young person slowly getting acclamated to thechallenges of navigating the job market. At this time (meaning summer2017), I won't be pursuing a formal writing or editing internship. It's abit of a departure, but I'm actually aiming for a career in data science;my dream is to work as a data analyst in a publishing company (where my momprobably got the magazine idea from), where I can do something analyticalin a creatively-motivated environment.That being said, any internship opportunities from your company in oraround the field of data science would be much appreciated! I'll take sometime to peruse the sites you forwarded as well. If you have time, a quickphone call would be wonderful -- I know it's been a while since we'vecommunicated, and now that I'm slowly transitioning out of designated babyof the family and into a Real Thinking Adult with Ideas, I feel like theconversations I'll have with relatives will be more fruitful and meaningfulthan they've ever been. Anyway, I hope all's been well up north. Lookingforward to hearing from you!Love,Aina-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Political Science B.A. | Statistics Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

I am at an early stage of myresearch in which I am just trying to talk to people in the Taiwanese andChinese API community around Los Angeles to get a sense of how thecommunity works and what it cares about. Since your group is not involvedin politics, I would not ask about its political activities, but I wouldlike to ask about other groups that might be politically active. This is ahard thing to learn about from public sources and some informants would benecessary to get my research properly started.

Theletter will go to the Taiwanese American Foundation, as we talked aboutearlier today, and to Asian Americans Advancing Justice<http://www.advancingjustice-la.org/>, who had this bit of usefulinformation:""Unfortunately, we aren't able to help as we are a charitable nonprofitorganization and cannot (and do not) take positions on candidates orparties.""Another update: I got a response from the Executive Vice President of TaiwaneseAmerican Professionals - Los Angeles <http://www.tap-la.org/>, Mr. TonyChou, who agreed to set up an interview for this Thursday. I'll think of afew questions to ask him and send them in another email, so this onedoesn't get too long.The drafted email is below:Dear ____,Thank you for your response.

What is the nature ofthe work done at each level?How often does APAICS involve itself with API community organizations?Taiwanese or Chinese API groups?Does APAICS have representatives outside of Washington D.C.?My research project looks at open seat nominations to the House in the2013-14 election cycle, one of which was won by Ted Lieu in California‰Ûªs33rd district, or the district that UCLA is in. Does the APAICS have arelationship with Lieu, either while he was campaigning to be aRepresentative or after he entered the House?What are some other organizations APAICS has worked with?Here are some other questions I have about my project that I'm hoping todiscuss with you tomorrow:   - Is it appropriate to try and contact someone on Lieu's team to ask if   the campaign was involved with Taiwanese or Chinese API groups?   - Can I follow up unanswered emails with a phone call?   - The Taiwanese American Foundation (TAF) foundation cited this response   in its decline to interview: ""Due to our 501c3 status, we are unable to be   involved in politics.""

An idea I have is to discuss, atthe beginning, certain feature of Dubuffet's work (drawing style, imprintprocess, artistic themes, etc); then the guide can have people break offinto pairs/groups, have different pairs look at different pieces, and thenhave pairs report how the style/process/theme is evoked in each art piece.If groups were smaller, though, I wouldn't mind sticking to one piece pertalking point.

"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 12:39:13 -0800","Hey!I really like the ideas that DJ threw around: resistance to the artworld/traditional artistic forms with Dubuffet, resistance to Americancolonialism with Durham. In these resistances, I also see a mutual desireto bring the unconventionally artistic into a more artistic light. Dubuffetdrew inspiration from children's drawings and psychiatric patients (puttingaside what he learned in art school) and Durham took second hand items andrepurposed them into art.Those are the only ideas that immediately come to mind that link the two.Would love to hear more ideas or further develop this one!On Mon, Jan 30, 2017 at 10:06 AM, Jarrett Lampley <jarrettlampley@gmail.com>wrote:> Hi you two!>> Just wanted to let you know that I talked to the coordinator of the law> event coming this Thursday, and she requested that we tour Jimmie Durham> and Dubuffet.

"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 19:31:10 -0700","Hey Clare,How are you? What is CA+T up to nowadays?Thank you again for the reading material; they've made me more cognizant ofmy roles and responsibilities as a person working abroad without actuallyliving here. Barbie Savior was my favorite! So weird how social mediasomehow brought a layer of vanity into the mess that voluntourism alreadyis. I'm thankful that the organization I work for doesn't succumb to thisweird 21st century voluntourism trend. I think the fact that it is aMalaysian-born organization that emphasizes learning and understandingamong its interns makes the experience feel a lot less disingenuous.It's hard to summarize how much interning abroad has helped me understandmyself and the rest of the world (cliche, I know) but I think one of themost important takeaways was seeing empowered SE Asian women making acareer out of their passion for human rights. I remember talking to youbefore about what a privilege it is to be surrounded by people doing workthey genuinely care about; it's truly inspiring to see people doing what Iwant to do *and* who actually look like me. I'd never really had any SEAsian woman role models in the legal field before now, so realizing howmany Filipina lawyers there are in this world helped me to see the glass-and bamboo-ceilings (some of them self-imposed) that discouraged me fromconsidering law. It meant a lot to see the world from the other side ofacademia, hahaAside from that, I had another thing I wanted to ask you about -- do youknow when Bovey Lee's interview will be published? I remember she requestedthat we send it over to her so she can post a link on her own website, too.Just didn't want to leave her hanging.Thank you!

"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 18:52:17 -0700","Dear Ms. Navarroza,Hello! My name is Aida Ylanan, and I'm a second year Political Science andStatistics student at UCLA. I currently work as an intern with the Centerfor Art and Thought, and we're developing a series of interviews withartists who have contributed to any of CA+T's exhibitions throughout theyears. I was revisiting our *Sea, Land, Air* exhibition when your workcaught my eye. Sarita See, the Executive Director of CA+T, and mysupervisor Clare Counihan (copied in this email) suggested your work wouldmake an excellent topic for an interview.CA+T interviews artists to learn more about their background, theinspirations for their work, and what they hope to convey through theirpieces. Sample interviews can be found here<http://www.centerforartandthought.org/cat-interview-johanna-poethig> andhere <http://centerforartandthought.org/cat-interviews-laura-swanson>. Allarticles are run by the artist before their publication.Most interviews are conducted via email, but we would be delighted toconduct a Skype or telephone interview as well -- whichever you prefer. Theinterview is more casual than formal, and we would like to learn more aboutyour photography techniques and artistic process.What drew me into your work was your choice of artistic subject. Your *PerhapsIt Was Possibly Because *series features arguably banal subjects, but notin the negative sense of the word; rather, each tableau seems to extractmeaning from a scene otherwise overlooked because of its normalcy. I'd loveto talk more with you about what you see in the world through your cameralens, and perhaps I could learn a thing or two about how to see my dailyroutine in a new light.Thank you for your time, and thank you for your thoughtful contributions toCA+T. I look forward to seeing more of your art in the future!Warmly,Aida Ylanan-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Political Science B.A. | Statistics Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

SaritaSee, the Executive Director of CA+T, and my supervisor Clare Counihan(copied in this email) suggested your work would make an excellent topicfor an interview.CA+T interviews artists to learn more about their background, theinspirations for their work, and what they hope to convey through theirpieces. Sample interviews can be found here<http://www.centerforartandthought.org/cat-interview-johanna-poethig> andhere <http://centerforartandthought.org/cat-interviews-laura-swanson>. Allarticles are run by the artist before their publication.Most interviews are conducted via email, but because CA+T operates out ofthe Los Angeles area, our team is enthusiastic about the idea of an instudio interview! With your permission, we could arrange an interview atyour studio during a time/date most convenient for you. The interview wouldconsist of a photo-documented tour, along with some questions asked duringand after the tour. Our conversation is intended to be more casual thanformal, and any audio recording would be used to transcribe the interviewlater on. The interview and corresponding photos would be published onlywith your final approval. If you would prefer to hold an interview overemail instead, then CA+T would be happy to continue to correspond with youdigitally!What drew me into your work was how incredibly delicate and intricate eachpiece is. The nature of your medium alone adds unique thematic elementsthat contribute to the meaning of each work, and I'd love to explore thesethemes with you in person. I'm also very much interested in what inspiredyou to become an artist, where your inspiration comes from for particularpieces, and what sorts of stories you aim to tell in your art.Thank you for your time, and thank you for your spellbinding contributionsto CA+T. I look forward to seeing more of your art in the future!Warmly,Aida Ylanan-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*Intern | Center for Art and Thought | http://centerforartandthought.org/University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Political Science B.A. | Statistics Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

Interns typically look for their own housing--I found my placeonline near the office a couple of days before I started with WAO lastyear! It is a shared accommodation in an apartment with other tenantsrenting other rooms. There are AirBnB options that seem really affordabletoo, especially since you're only here for a month. We're located near AsiaJaya LRT station, in Section 14 Petaling Jaya, also close to Jaya ShoppingCentre and the Digital Mall. Apartments nearby include Millennium Square,Menara Jaya, and Centrestage. There is also the option of renting a room ina house.""The WAO Office's address is Jalan Sultan 46760 Petaling Jaya Selangor,Malaysia (just typing in Womens Aid Organisation into Google Maps willreturn the correct location).Searching Petaling Jaya Selangor Malaysia into airbnb.com gave me the listof nearby rooms/apts available for rent.I'll ask Lainey if there are any other interns from the U.S. coming thissummer. Let me know if there is any other information you'd like me to ask.Thank you!

I'vebeen honestly feeling quite discouraged just thinking about the dauntingtask of learning two languages nearly from scratch, but after reading youradvice and looking through these links, I can see that learning both arevery possible things to do. I'll be looking through the course catalog forprogramming classes at LBCC this week and doing some reading in themeantime! Knowing what I have to do to achieve my goals is one of the bestfeelings ever; thanks for helping me realize that.I'm sure I'll need your help, guidance, and motivation as I move alongthrough these courses, so I'll be sure to stay in touch. As a fellowFilipina Bruin, I'll be sure to make you and the rest of PAA proud!Have a wonderful week.Best,On Fri, Apr 1, 2016 at 9:55 PM, Matthew David <matt.david@hulu.com> wrote:> Hi Aida!>> It was great speaking to you, too.

"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 14:22:09 -0800","Hello!My name is Aida Ylanan, and I'm a second year who's very much interested inapplying to the Social Thought minor. I have a few questions about it, andif it would be much easier for me to come into your office and talk to youabout it, I'd be happy to do that as well!My interest in the minor stemmed from my burgeoning interest in thephilosophical texts we read in Political Science 10. I wish to read moreabout modern philosophy and, more specifically, to use this interest inbettering my critical reading and writing skills.I'm a bit hesitant to apply to the major, however, because I currently haveno plans to pursue Political Science in graduate school. Instead, I amconsidering law school. Is the Social Thought minor developed specificallyfor those planning to get post-graduate humanities degrees in mind? Is itokay to participate in the minor purely out of interest?Thank you!-- *Aida Avelina Ylanan*University of California, Los Angeles | Class of 2018Political Science B.A. | Statistics Minora1daylanan@ucla.edu | (562) 673-1996"

I'm pursuing a Statistics minor, and I'm worried that this willnegatively affect my current GPA and make it less competitive comeapplication time.2) What sorts of programs/clubs are available on campus to see if lawschool is something I want to pursue? My family has had nobackground/connections to the field of law whatsoever, so I feel a bit lostabout what I'm about to head into. I do want to strengthen my reading,writing, and critical thinking skills past my bachelor's degree, and Ifigured that the knowledge picked up in law school will be useful in manycareers (I don't know what I want to do yet), so I'm currently exploringthe pre-law option.3) What sorts of skills (besides critical thinking, reading and writing)are necessary to be successful in law school?Thank you for your help!

I hope you had awonderful stay in Malaysia. I am very glad to know that you are nowconsidering active involvement in non-profits!(Also - I am copying my gmail address as I am trying to now migrate fromthis ancient yahoo address so do use that one in the future! thanks).I could definitely assist with internships in Malaysia. For UN internshipsin Geneva or New York for example, there is a set procedure which you caneasily follow from their websites, as I don't have any direct contacts forthis.I would suggest you start your internship with an NGO in Malaysia, givenalso the presence of family this helps a lot for your first experience. Irecommend working with my good friend and ex-mentor Sumitra Visvanathan whoheads the Women's Aid Organization (WAO) a leading NGO in Malaysia focusedon domestic violence for women and children. WAO has a very establishedadvocacy platform in addiiton to their core service of running shelters(you can check out their website for more info).Sumitra also has 15 years of experience working with the UNHCR, and she isa particularly dynamic individual you will enjoy working with. I referredanother sophomore student from Wharton recently to her, and this was a verygood exchange for both.I would also suggest that you try and narrow your area of interest inworking with NGOs - eg are you keen on issues related to women? refugees?migrants? child protection for the sexually abused? the environment? artsand heritage? access to education? juvenile justice?  This will make iteasier for you to know which organizations you should apply to. I shouldalso say there are fabulous NGOs in the US which you should also consideran internship with.So let's start with that - if you like, we can have a quick chat over Skypeto help you narrow your interest areas or if you know this already then dosend me your thoughts (at the gmail account) and let me know why you areinterested in it - articulating your passion helps to focus your thoughts!I am also available on facebook under Sharifah Nazneen - and can forwardyou stuff suited to your interests as and when I receive it.For Sumitra/WAO, if you send me your cv as well as a cover note statingyour interest to be an intern with WAO I can forward this to her and youcan start communicating directly with her on a potential internship.regards,Nazneen--------------------------------------------On Wed, 26/8/15, AIDA AVELINA YLANAN <a1daylanan@ucla.edu> wrote: Subject: Meeting Follow-Up To: nazneen_agha@yahoo.co.uk Date: Wednesday, 26 August, 2015, 8:09 Hello Ms. Agha, My name is Aida Ylanan, and I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you again for meeting with me and my aunt and uncle (Mr. and Mrs. Ghazzali) at the Hilton Hotel in KL two weeks ago.
